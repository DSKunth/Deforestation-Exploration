# Deforestation Exploration

ForestQuery, a fictitious non-profit organization, is on a mission to reduce deforestation around the world and to raise awareness about the importance of this environmental subject. <br><br>
The goal of this project is to help ForestQuery management understand the global deforestation overview between 1990 and 2016. Three tables of data have been found online: forest area, land area, and regions.<br><br>
The task is to present a report to ForestQuery management about the global situation, regional outlook, and country-level details of deforestation as well as recommendations. In the appendix, all SQL queries should be presented according to the SQL formatting guidelines.
