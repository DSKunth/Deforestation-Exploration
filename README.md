# Deforestation Exploration
ForestQuery, a fictitious non-profit organization, is on a mission to reduce deforestation around the world and to raise awareness about the importance of this environmental subject.
The leadership team is looking to understand which countries and regions around the world seem to have forests that have been shrinking in size, and also which countries and regions have the most significant forest area, both in terms of amount and percent of total area.<br>
The hope is that these findings can help inform initiatives, communications, and personnel allocation to achieve the largest impact with the precious few resources that the organization has at its disposal.
<br>
The goal of this project is to help ForestQuery management understand the global deforestation overview between 1990 and 2016. Three tables of data have been found online: forest area, land area, and regions. The task is to bring these tables together and query the answers to some of the most important questions in preparation for a meeting with the ForestQuery executive team.
